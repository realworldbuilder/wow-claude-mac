# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- macOS support. `bridge/capture-mac.swift` is the screen capture for the Mac client: ScreenCaptureKit screenshots of the game window only, a search for the strip below the title bar and at 1x/2x pixel density, sRGB conversion for Display P3 panels, and a clear message (plus a once-a-minute retry) when Screen Recording permission is missing. `setup.js` finds the `.app` client under `/Applications`, writes its path as `capture.processName`, and compiles the helper with `swiftc` into `bridge/bin/`. `bridge/start.command` is the double-click launcher. `docs/INSTALL-MACOS.md` walks through it.
- `/wow-claude diag` prints the physical screen size the strip is drawn at; the copy box says Cmd+C on a Mac.

### Changed

- The test suite runs on macOS as well as Windows (the codec round-trip uses the platform's real decoder, and skips itself elsewhere); CI runs both.
- Tool-use progress lines (`edit player.gd`) take the last path segment whichever separator the path uses.
- Chat folder comparison is case-sensitive on Linux file systems, case-insensitive on Windows and macOS.
- Rename and Folder moved off the bottom row into a small menu that opens when you right-click a chat in the left panel.
- Each chat row has a trash can that deletes the chat after an OK/Cancel confirm; `/wow-claude delete` still deletes without asking.
- Send sits at the right end of the input box instead of at the left of the bottom row.
- The bridge no longer exits when the addon folder is missing from `Interface\AddOns`; it logs one warning and the banner shows `addon : NOT INSTALLED`.

### Fixed

- Deleting a chat in game now tells the bridge to forget its transcript and Claude session (a `d` strip record), so a later restore no longer brings the chat back. Deletions made while the bridge was away are resent with the next hello.
- On clients where the sound-file self-test fails (an empty `.wav` reports as playable), the addon can't hear the bridge's 30-second presence beats, and the status light went yellow 90 s after every reply, so each new message needed a Reconnect click and burned a slot. In that mode the light now allows for the 10-minute idle slot poll (green up to 12 min without news, "down" after 22), so it stays green while the bridge is running.
- A message sent while the light is not green is now sent automatically once the bridge answers the reconnect, instead of waiting for a second click on Send.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-22

First public release.

### Added

- In-game chat window (`/wow-claude`) with multiple chats, each backed by its own persistent Claude Code session, running in parallel up to `maxParallel`.
- Outbound transport: messages drawn as a pixel strip in the top-left corner and decoded by a PowerShell screen capture.
- Inbound transport: a pool of 200 load-on-demand slot addons the bridge writes replies into, plus `Inbox.lua` for the `/reload` fallback.
- Empty-wav signal files for acknowledgements, reply readiness, per-action heartbeats, and a 30-second presence beat that drives the status light.
- Live progress in the working bubble: action count, elapsed time, and the files and commands Claude is touching.
- Replies echoed into the game chat; `/r` replies to Claude when it was the last to message you; `/ai <text>` sends from the chat box.
- **Allow & retry** button when Claude is denied a tool, which appends the rule to `allowedTools` and resumes.
- Per-chat working folder (`/wow-claude cd`, **Folder** button) resolved against the bridge's default folder.
- Bridge-side transcripts and automatic restore of chats after the client wipes addon saved data.
- `wow-claude` command (`npm link`) that uses the folder it is started from as the default project.
- `setup.js` installer: finds the client, copies the addon, writes `config.json`, builds the slot pool.
- Test suite: addon in a Lua VM with a stub client, protocol unit tests, slot-file round trip, codec-to-decoder round trip, and a live inject test.
